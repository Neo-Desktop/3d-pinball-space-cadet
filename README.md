Please visit [@k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball](https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball) for a version that's significantly further along in development than what this repository can provide.

I apologize that I haven't had time to work on this - I hope that an enhanced version of our favorite historic game surfaces eventually.

Thank you for all your support - I look forward to serving the community again in the future.

## Disassembly of the Iconic 3D Pinball Space Cadet Win32 game

**Overview:**
The goal of this project is to make a functional, portable, solution compatible with the `3D Pinball Space Cadet` distributed game files:
`FONT.DAT`
`PINBALL.DAT`

An additional  goal of this project is to make native applications for the following platforms:
* `Windows`
* `macOS`
* `Linux`
* `Android`

`iOS` and `Windows Mobile`  will be stretch goals for the mobile platform segment of the project.


**Planned enhancements**:

* MP3-based sounds archive (as a `SOUND.DAT` file).
* Re-mastered background music (as MP3 in `SOUND.DAT` archive).
* Compatability with other `Maxis` / `Cinnematronics` tables.
